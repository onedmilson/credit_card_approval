# ✅ Credit Card Approval Prediction

This project predicts credit card approval using a logistic regression model trained on a structured dataset. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model training, and a simple Streamlit app interface.

## 🚀 Features

- Predict approval status of credit card applications
- Comparative analysis of multiple ML models
- Clean and organized EDA
- Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost
- Simple Streamlit web interface
- Structured folder architecture for clarity and collaboration
